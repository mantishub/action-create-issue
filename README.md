# MantisHub Create Issue GitHub Action

There can be cases where it makes sense to create issues in MantisHub from GitHub actions. For
example:

- After creating a new release, create a work item for follow-up steps.
- When build breaks, open a work item to fix it.
- Certain workflow that is manually creating and includes some manual work to be done as a follow-up.

## Usage

To use this action in your GitHub workflow, add the following step to your workflow file:

```yaml
jobs:
  create-issue:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check out code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          repository: mantishub/action-create-issue
      - name: Create an Issue
        id: create-issue
        uses: mantishub/action-create-issue@v1
        with:
          url: https://example.mantishub.io
          api-key: ${{ secrets.API_KEY }}
          project: 'MyProject'
          summary: "Build is broken"
          description: |
            The build is broken.
            Error message is "xxxxxxxx"
          category: 'General'

```

## Example workflow file

This workflow demonstrates how to use the `action-create-issue` in a GitHub Actions workflow to create a new issue in a MantisHub project. The workflow checks out the code, runs the custom action, and retrieves the new issue ID.

## Using Step ID to Fetch Outputs in GitHub Actions

In GitHub Actions, you can use the id field to assign a unique identifier to a step within a job. This identifier allows you to reference the outputs of that step in subsequent steps within the same job.

For example, in the workflow below, the step `Create an Issue` action is assigned the ID `create-issue`. Later, the output issue-id generated by this step can be accessed using the syntax `${{ steps.create-issue.outputs.issue-id }`} in the `Get new issue id` step.

```yaml
name: "MantisHub Example Workflow"

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  create-issue:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check out code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          repository: mantishub/action-create-issue
      - name: Create an Issue
        id: create-issue
        uses: mantishub/action-create-issue@v1
        with:
          url: 'https://example.mantishub.io'
          api-key: {{some-token}}
          project: 'MyProject'
          summary: 'Opening an sample issue'
          description: |
            This is a sample issue
            Opened via Github Action
          category: 'General'
      - name: Get new issue id
        run: echo  ${{ steps.create-issue.outputs.issue-id }}
```
